# Changelog

All notable changes to `aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian` are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) — semantic versioning applies to `REPO_VERSION`; upstream Claude Desktop bumps (the `+claude{X.Y.Z}` suffix on the tag) are tracked separately by the `check-claude-version` workflow.

## [Unreleased]

<!-- Updated automatically by check-claude-version; will be current at release time. -->

## [v2.0.14] — 2026-05-25

Tracks upstream Claude Desktop 1.8555.2.

### Fixed

- `WM_CLASS` and `StartupWMClass` aligned to `claude-desktop` across all formats (deb, RPM, AppImage, autostart). Resolves ambiguity with the Claude Code CLI (`claude`) and ensures consistent taskbar grouping on KDE/GNOME. ([#648](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/648), fixes [#647](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/647))

### Changed

- AppImage smoke test: replaced flat 10s sleep with readiness-marker poll (30s ceiling, 0.5s tick), unified cleanup trap to prevent 190MB `squashfs-root` leaks on interrupt. ([#646](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/646))

## [v2.0.13] — 2026-05-24

Tracks upstream Claude Desktop 1.8555.2.

### Added

- `CLAUDE_KEEP_AWAKE=0` env var to suppress `powerSaveBlocker` sleep inhibitor that upstream holds indefinitely on Linux (no lifecycle management). Adds diagnostic logging for all `powerSaveBlocker` calls and `--doctor` visibility. ([#605](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/605))
- `--doctor` flags filesystems with `NAME_MAX < 200` (eCryptfs, certain encrypted overlays) and surfaces the LUKS-symlink workaround for cowork. Thanks @RayCharlizard, @lizthegrey for the repro. ([#614](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/614), fixes [#590](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/590))
- F11 fullscreen toggle via hidden menu accelerator — Linux parity with macOS green button / Windows F11. ([#638](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/638), fixes [#580](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/580))
- Linux org-plugins path (`/etc/claude/org-plugins`) added to platform switch, enabling MDM-managed plugin configuration. ([#639](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/639), fixes [#607](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/607))
- Top-level governance docs: this `CHANGELOG.md`, [`RELEASING.md`](RELEASING.md) (pre-release checklist + tag-driven CI flow), [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) (private GHSA reporting + in/out-of-scope), [`docs/index.md`](docs/index.md) (navigation hub), and [`docs/styleguides/docs_styleguide.md`](docs/styleguides/docs_styleguide.md) (page anatomy, naming, antipatterns). [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) gains explicit § Required reading, § Anti-patterns, and § Docs sections; [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) becomes a byte-identical mirror of the new body (was a 13-line stub) so non-Claude tools get the same instructions.
- [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) "Before you start" triage section: where to go for a bug, a fix-in-hand, a new-feature ask, or a security report.
- `--password-store` keyring detection: probes D-Bus for kwallet6 / gnome-libsecret at startup and injects the flag before the app path, fixing session persistence on KDE Plasma and other desktops where `safeStorage.isEncryptionAvailable()` returned false. Adds `CLAUDE_PASSWORD_STORE` env override and `--doctor` diagnostic. Thanks @dubreal. ([#611](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/611), fixes [#593](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/593))
- Unzip fallback for Node 24: detects missing electron binary after `extract-zip` silently no-ops and recovers from the `@electron/get` cache using system `unzip`. Thanks @JustinJLeopard. ([#631](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/631), fixes [#584](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/584))

### Fixed

- Config writes no longer drop externally-added `mcpServers`. The stale in-memory cache was overwriting disk on every preference change; now re-reads `mcpServers` from disk before each write. ([#643](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/643), fixes [#400](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/400))
- Menu bar toggle fires on Alt keyup only, not keydown — fixes Alt+Shift (language switch) and Alt+F4 accidentally triggering the menu bar. `CLAUDE_MENU_BAR=hidden` disables the Alt toggle entirely. ([#642](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/642), fixes [#630](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/630))
- `.asar` paths rejected in directory check, preventing Electron's ASAR VFS shim from dispatching `app.asar` to Cowork as a "folder drop". Fixes permission dialog on every launch, forced Cowork mode on reopen from tray, and "No conversation found" loop in Claude Code >=2.1.111. ([#640](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/640), fixes [#383](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/383), [#622](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/622), [#632](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/632))
- Identifier captures across all patch scripts hardened from `\w+` to `[$\w]+` (PCRE) / `[[:alnum:]_$]+` (ERE). Fixes broken idempotency guard in `tray.sh`, adds missing guards to `cowork.sh` patches 6/9/10, adds `\s*` whitespace tolerance to multiple patterns. ([#644](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/644))
- `exec` before Electron invocation in deb, RPM, and Nix launchers so Ctrl+C and signals forward correctly to the Electron process. ([#637](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/637), fixes [#424](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/424))
- `--class=Claude` added to launcher args ensuring WM_CLASS matches `StartupWMClass` in the .desktop file, preventing GNOME extension crashes from unexpected class values. ([#636](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/636), ref [#635](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/635))
- Sloppy/focus-follows-mouse: suppress redundant `webContents.focus()` calls that trigger X11 `_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW` raise-on-hover. Grace window handles stale `isFocused()` on tray-restore and minimize-restore. Thanks @tkrag. ([#589](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/589), fixes [#416](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/416))
- Tray: extracted JS identifier captures now accept `$` so the 1.8089.1 minified bundle ('`i$A`' menu handler) matches. Switches `\w+` to `[\w$]+`. ([#627](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/627), fixes [#625](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/625))
- RPM: silence "File listed twice" warning on `chrome-sandbox` by moving `chmod 4755` into `%install` (replaces `%attr` in `%files`). Adds regression guard that fails the build if the warning reappears. Thanks @JoshuaVlantis. ([#610](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/610), fixes [#609](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/609))
- Window close with `CLAUDE_QUIT_ON_CLOSE=1` now actively quits via `app.quit()` instead of relying on the bundled handler that hardcodes hide-to-tray on Linux. Rides upstream's own quit-in-progress guard. Thanks @phelps-matthew. ([#624](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/624), fixes [#623](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/623))
- node-pty: wipe upstream Windows binaries (winpty.dll, winpty-agent.exe, Windows `.node` files) before staging the Linux build, preventing PE32+ orphans in the packaged asar. Thanks @JoshuaVlantis. ([#597](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/597), addresses [#401](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/401))

### Changed

- CI injection hardening: moved `${{ steps.*.outputs.* }}` expressions from `run:` blocks to `env:` blocks in `issue-triage-v2.yml`. Build pipeline: `process.exit(0)` → `process.exit(1)` in `quick-window.sh` when patch anchors aren't found so CI fails instead of shipping broken patches. Packaging scriptlets: replaced `&> /dev/null` with `> /dev/null 2>&1` for dash compatibility in deb/RPM postinst. ([#641](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/641))
- Credit @lizthegrey, @sabiut, @typedrat, @RayCharlizard in README Acknowledgments. ([#626](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/626))
- Troubleshooting: new "Repeated Electron Crashes / GPU Process FATAL" section documenting `CLAUDE_DISABLE_GPU=1`. Adds tuning-rationale comments around the `--doctor` 3-in-7-days threshold and the `coredumpctl` `COMM=electron` assumption. Thanks @sabiut. ([#615](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/615), addresses [#608](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/608))
- Docs filenames are now lowercase kebab-case (`docs/building.md`, `docs/configuration.md`, `docs/decisions.md`, `docs/troubleshooting.md`); `STYLEGUIDE.md` moved to [`docs/styleguides/bash_styleguide.md`](docs/styleguides/bash_styleguide.md). Cross-references swept across README, CONTRIBUTING, CODEOWNERS, `.github/`, `.claude/`, `scripts/`, and `claude-desktop --doctor` user-facing output.
- `[$\w]+` is the codified identifier-capture convention for patch-script regexes (CONTRIBUTING § Patch-script regexes; `patch-engineer` agent examples updated to match). Closes a docs-vs-code gap that left the rule only in [`docs/learnings/patching-minified-js.md`](docs/learnings/patching-minified-js.md) — the same `\w+` trap fixed in patches by [#555](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/555) and [#627](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/627).

## [v2.0.12] — 2026-05-19

Tracks upstream Claude Desktop 1.7196.3.

### Added

- Headless launch + `--doctor` smoke tests for the AppImage artifact. ([#592](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/592))

### Changed

- CI: add concurrency group to `test-flags` workflow. ([#606](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/606))

## [v2.0.11] — 2026-05-16

Tracks upstream Claude Desktop 1.7196.1.

### Fixed

- Catch About window after upstream `titleBarStyle` change; guard Hardware Buddy. ([#481](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/481), [#489](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/489))
- RPM `chrome-sandbox` SUID now set via `%attr` instead of `%post chmod`. ([#539](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/539), [#595](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/595))
- No-op `autoUpdater` on Linux to defend against feed activation; mask thenable/coercion traps on the Proxy. ([#567](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/567), [#596](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/596))
- `node-pty` install fails loudly on `npm install` failure; require `gcc`/`make`/`python3`. ([#401](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/401), [#598](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/598))
- Fetch electron binary via `@electron/get`, drop `^41` pin; resolve from `work_dir` not script dir. ([#587](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/587))
- Dedupe packages mapped from multiple commands.

## [v2.0.10] — 2026-05-06

Tracks upstream Claude Desktop 1.6259.0, 1.6259.1, 1.6608.0, 1.6608.2, 1.7196.0.

### Added

- `--doctor` surfaces recent Electron crashes with a `#583` pointer; `CLAUDE_DISABLE_GPU=1` opt-in for GPU-process fatal crashes. ([#583](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/583), [#585](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/585))
- `--doctor` detects IBus/GTK misconfigurations that break input. ([#572](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/572))
- Launcher: `CLAUDE_GTK_IM_MODULE` opt-in override. ([#571](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/571))
- Launcher: log session/IME env block at startup. ([#570](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/570))
- Linux compatibility test harness. ([#579](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/579))
- Lifecycle: notify and offer restart on in-place package upgrade. ([#564](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/564))
- `desktopName` set for Wayland window grouping. Thanks @jslatten. ([#562](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/562))

### Fixed

- Pin electron to `^41` to restore postinstall binary fetch. ([#584](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/584), [#586](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/586))
- Nix: make electron binary executable. ([#581](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/581))
- `cowork.sh`: emit WARNING on Patch 2a/2b inner anchor miss. ([#576](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/576))
- CI: force primary GPG key for `repomd.xml` signing. Thanks @ProfFlow. ([#566](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/566))
- DNF: set `metadata_expire=1h` on generated `.repo`. ([#551](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/551))
- BATS: isolate `cleanup_stale_cowork_socket` from host `pgrep` state. ([#534](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/534))

### Changed

- Static-grep shipped asar for PR #555 markers as a verification step. ([#559](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/559), [#575](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/575))
- New `patching-minified-js` learnings doc + `CONTRIBUTING`. ([#574](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/574))

- Archive upstream report draft for #546 (filed as `anthropics/claude-code#55353`). ([#552](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/552))

## [v2.0.8] — 2026-05-02

Tracks upstream Claude Desktop 1.5354.0 (unchanged from v2.0.7).

### Fixed

- Cowork starts again on Claude Desktop 1.5354.0. Upstream's minifier started emitting `$`-containing identifiers (`C$i`, `g$i`); two regex anchors in `scripts/patches/cowork.sh` used `\w+`, which doesn't match `$`. Patch 2b silently no-op'd, the Swift VM module assignment never landed, and you'd hit `Swift VM addon not available` at session init. Widens both anchors to `[\w$]+`. Patch 6 also moves from `indexOf` to `lastIndexOf` on the retry-delay anchor. Thanks @sirfaber, @HumboldtJoker, @zabka. ([#555](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/555), fixes [#558](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/558), likely fixes [#553](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/553) and [#445](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/445))

## [v2.0.7] — 2026-05-01

Tracks upstream Claude Desktop 1.5354.0 (unchanged from v2.0.6).

### Added

- Linux in-app topbar works now. New `hybrid` titlebar mode is the default: native OS frame plus a BrowserView preload shim that satisfies claude.ai's UA gate, so the hamburger, sidebar, search, and nav buttons render and are clickable. Layout is stacked (DE titlebar above the in-app topbar) rather than combined like Windows. Set `CLAUDE_TITLEBAR_STYLE=native` to opt out and hide the in-app topbar. The upstream `frame:false` + WCO config is preserved as `hidden` for investigation but still has unclickable buttons on Linux; `--doctor` warns when it's active. Verified on KDE Plasma X11/Wayland and Hyprland; GNOME, Sway, Niri, and NixOS pending. ([#538](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/538))

## [v2.0.6] — 2026-05-01

Tracks upstream Claude Desktop 1.5354.0. Absorbs three upstream bumps from v2.0.5: 1.4758.0, 1.5220.0, 1.5354.0.

### Added

- Cowork bwrap mounts accept a `{src, dst}` form, so you can map a host directory under `$HOME` onto a different path inside the sandbox. Unlocks persistent-`/tmp` so Bash tool calls don't wipe state between invocations. String form unchanged. Thanks @cbonnissent. ([#531](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/531))
- `--doctor` warns when `COWORK_VM_BACKEND` is set to an unknown value instead of silently falling through to auto-detect; adds a `COWORK_VM_BACKEND` row and a Cowork Backend section to `docs/configuration.md`. Thanks @CyPack. ([#324](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/324))
- `--doctor` warns when an additional bwrap mount destination shadows a default sandbox path like `/usr`, `/etc`, `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/lib`. ([#531](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/531))
- Troubleshooting entries for Cowork VM connection timeout, virtiofsd outside `$PATH` on Fedora/RHEL (`/usr/libexec/virtiofsd`), and Fedora tmpfs `EXDEV` errors. ([#324](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/324))

### Fixed

- Closing the window no longer kills the app on Linux. The X button hides to tray, matching Windows and macOS. Quit explicitly with Ctrl+Q, the tray menu, or your DE's quit shortcut. Set `CLAUDE_QUIT_ON_CLOSE=1` to restore the old behavior. Fixes scheduled tasks and `/schedule` firings getting silently dropped overnight. Thanks @lizthegrey. ([#451](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/451))
- "Run on startup" toggle persists on Linux now. Electron's `setLoginItemSettings` isn't implemented on Linux; the wrapper backs the toggle with `~/.config/autostart/claude-desktop.desktop` per the XDG Autostart spec. Thanks @lizthegrey. ([#450](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/450), fixes [#128](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/128))
- Tray icon updates in place on OS theme change instead of briefly duplicating on KDE Plasma. Uses `setImage` + `setContextMenu` rather than destroy + recreate. Thanks @IliyaBrook. ([#515](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/515))
- Window visibility check works again after an upstream minified-name change broke it. Thanks @Andrej730. ([#496](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/496), fixes [#495](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/495))

### Changed

- APT/DNF install instructions point at `pkg.claude-desktop-debian.dev` directly, bypassing the GitHub Pages 301. Pages serves the redirect over `http://` because it can't provision a cert for the `pkg.` subdomain (DNS belongs to the Cloudflare Worker), and `apt` refuses HTTPS→HTTP downgrades. DNF was unaffected. ([#510](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/510), [#514](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/514))

- Rename `feature` classification to `enhancement` in triage. ([#466](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/466))

## [v2.0.0] — 2026-04-20

First v2 wrapper release; tracks upstream Claude Desktop 1.3109.0, 1.3561.0.

### Added

- Always-on lifecycle logging for `cowork-vm-service`. ([#408](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/408))
- `cowork-vm-daemon` learnings doc and Anthropic & Partners plugin install flow doc. ([#439](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/439))
- `.github/CODEOWNERS` for per-subsystem review ownership.
- `shellcheck -x` to follow sourced modules in CI.

### Fixed

- Restore `cowork-vm-service` daemon recovery after crash. ([#408](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/408))
- Forward `userSelectedFolders[0]` as `sharedCwdPath` on cowork spawn. ([#412](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/412), [#436](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/436))
- Strip mode on `node-pty` cp at source; retire `chmod`. Chmod `node-pty` unpacked files before overwriting in Nix builds. ([#432](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/432), [#438](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/438))
- Diagnose AppArmor userns block on bwrap probe. ([#351](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/351), [#434](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/434))
- Suppress Cowork tab auto-select on every launch. ([#341](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/341), [#433](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/433))
- `home --dir` before SDK `--ro-bind` in bwrap sandbox. ([#426](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/426))
- Only route `claude` commands through SDK binary in `cowork-vm-service`. ([#430](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/430))
- `launcher-common.sh` self-match and stale socket cleanup. ([#407](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/407), [#425](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/425))
- Translate guest paths inside `--allowedTools` and `--disallowedTools`. ([#411](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/411))
- Resolve working directory from primary mount on HostBackend. ([#392](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/392))

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Split `build.sh` into topical modules under `scripts/`; relocate packaging scripts into `scripts/packaging/`; extract `--doctor` into `scripts/doctor.sh`. Patch files now live in `scripts/patches/*.sh` (one per subsystem); `build.sh` is just an orchestrator. CI paths updated to `scripts/setup/detect-host.sh`.
- Simplify cowork daemon recovery patch. ([#408](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/408))
